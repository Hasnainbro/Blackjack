### Blackjack

## Introduction

This is a simple command-line-based implementation of the classic card game Blackjack (also known as 21).In this Python-based game, you'll play against the computer to see who can get the closest to 21 without going over. It's fun and easy to pass the time and practice your Blackjack skills.

# How to Play
1. Start the Game: Run the main.py file to start the game. You'll see a welcome message and the game's logo.

2. Deal the Cards: You and the computer will be dealt two cards each. The goal is to get as close to 21 without exceeding it.

3. Game Flow: The game proceeds in a turn-based manner. You can choose to "Hit" (take an additional card) or "Stand" (keep your current cards).

4. Winning Conditions: You can win by getting a Blackjack (an Ace and a 10-point card) or having a higher score than the computer without going over 21.

5. Losing Conditions: You lose if you go over 21 or if the computer gets a higher score than you.

6. Ties: If your score and the computer's score are the same, it's a draw.

# Code Explanation

* The code uses the random module to simulate card drawing and the os module to clear the terminal screen.
* It defines functions for drawing cards, calculating scores, and comparing scores to determine the winner.
* The main game loop handles user input, card drawing, and the game's logic.
* The game is running in a loop, so you can play multiple rounds if you wish.
